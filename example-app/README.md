# Example App for `@capgo/capacitor-wechat`

This Vite project links directly to the local plugin source so you can exercise the native APIs while developing.

## Actions in this playground

- **Check if installed** – Calls isInstalled() to check if WeChat is installed.
- **Authenticate** – Opens WeChat OAuth authentication flow.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Add native shells with `npx cap add ios` or `npx cap add android` from this folder to try behaviour on device or simulator.
